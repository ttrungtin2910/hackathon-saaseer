# Multi-File Upload Feature

## âœ… What's New

### ðŸŽ¯ **Multiple File Upload Support**
- Upload multiple contract files at once
- Drag & drop multiple files simultaneously
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Individual file results display

### ðŸ”„ **New Workflow**
1. **Select Multiple Files**: Drag & drop or click to select multiple files
2. **Review Selection**: See list of selected files with sizes
3. **Upload All**: Click "Upload All Files" button
4. **Batch Processing**: Files processed sequentially with progress tracking
5. **Results Display**: See success/failure status for each file

### ðŸ“Š **Enhanced UI Features**

#### File Selection Area
- **Multiple file support**: `multiple: true`
- **File list display**: Shows selected files with sizes
- **Remove individual files**: Can remove files before uploading
- **Upload button**: "Upload All Files" button appears when files selected

#### Progress Tracking
- **Overall progress**: Shows progress across all files
- **Current file indicator**: "Uploading file X of Y"
- **Stage messages**: Updated to show current file being processed

#### Results Display
- **Individual results**: Card for each file showing success/failure
- **Extracted data preview**: Shows key extracted fields for successful uploads
- **Error messages**: Clear error display for failed uploads
- **Summary**: Success/failure counts in notifications

### ðŸŽ¨ **UI Components Added**
- `Button` with UploadOutlined icon
- `Space` for better layout
- `List` to display selected files
- `Card` to show upload results
- `CheckCircleOutlined` and `DeleteOutlined` icons

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes**

#### State Management
```javascript
const [uploadResults, setUploadResults] = useState([]);
const [currentFileIndex, setCurrentFileIndex] = useState(0);
const [totalFiles, setTotalFiles] = useState(0);
```

#### Upload Logic
- **Sequential processing**: Files uploaded one by one to avoid overwhelming the server
- **Error handling**: Individual file failures don't stop other uploads
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress across all files
- **Result aggregation**: Collects results from all files

#### File Management
- **File validation**: Each file validated individually
- **Size limits**: 10MB per file (not total)
- **Type checking**: Same supported formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)

## ðŸš€ **How to Use**

### Step 1: Open Upload Modal
Click "Upload Contract" button on All Contracts page

### Step 2: Select Multiple Files

## ðŸ“‹ **Example Usage Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Batch Contract Upload
- User has 5 contract PDFs
- Drags all 5 files into upload area
- Clicks "Upload All Files"
- System processes each file sequentially
- Shows results for all 5 files

### Scenario 2: Mixed File Types
- User has 3 PDFs and 2 images
- Selects all files
- System processes each file regardless of type
- Shows appropriate results for each

### Scenario 3: Partial Success
- User uploads 10 files
- 8 files process successfully
- 2 files fail (invalid format, too large, etc.)
- System shows success for 8, errors for 2
- User can retry failed files individually

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**
